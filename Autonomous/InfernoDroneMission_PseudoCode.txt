  Drone Engagement in air
  {
    Enter normal drone prop orientation 
    Change propeller speed and whatnot depending on current drone velocity. Ensure the drone floats
  }

  Drone fly near dropoff tags
  {
    Do whatever terrain survey sequence we're implementing (GPS if desperate, Comically large apriltag, circles, loops, line)
    Find and locate first dropoff tags

    else
    {
      Engage onboard/manual control 
      manually fly drone safely over trash can
      Disengage rocket magnet manually
      Disengage onboard/manual control and continue autonomous mission sequence (fly over rocket 2)
    }
  }

  Fly over rocket 2 (terrain survey)
  {
    Using predetermined gps coordinates
    Center drone on top of april tag once april tag is found
  }

  Drone Precision Landing [parameter - minaltitude]
  {
    Stop descent at minaltitude
    Land
    Turn on onboard/manual control so that we can engage the magnet ourselves

{
  Launch Sequence 2
  {
    Fold drone into nosecone prop orientation
    Rocket launches
    if altitude reaches 350 feet
    {
      deploy airbreak system
    }
    if (apogee near, determined by velocity (everything going upwards at around 5 mph))

      record final altitude
    }

  Dronge Engagement in air 2 
  {
    Enter normal drone prop orientation 
    Change propeller speed and whatnot depending on current drone velocity. Ensure the drone floats (with the rocket body)
  }

  Descent and Land 2 (minaltitude)
  {
    Use predetermined coordinates if tag not found to find landing circle
    Descend once centered
    Stop at minaltitude
    land super slow (?)
    (Landing needs to be stable. Too fast and the rocket fins will break. Too slow and the rocket is likely to tip over and break the props)
